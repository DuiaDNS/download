Before running this script for the first time, please edit it and modify 'duiahost' and 'duiapassmd5' with your own values. If you don't know your own md5_pass please visit:

There are two different scripts, one for ipv4(duia-mtk4) and the other for ipv6(duia-mtk6). If your mikrotik router is dual-stack you might want to run both, for ipv4(A) and ipv6(AAAA) dns updates. 

Tested on: mikrotik 6.27
